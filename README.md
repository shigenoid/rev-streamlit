**Model Specifications:**
                
    This model's purpose was to detect a type of bottles based on its material 
                
    - **List of classes:** 
      - 🥫 can-bottle | 🧴 plastic-bottle | 🍾 glass-bottle | 📦 tetrapak
                
    **Current Limitations:**
                
    Keep in mind that the models will be used in an environment where only such conditions will exists so there will
    be some limitations such as:
                
    1. **Single-Class Detection Preference**  
       The model tends to detect only the most prominent object in a frame when multiple objects are present.  
    
    2. **Optimal Detection Conditions**  
       Works best with:
       - Single objects centered in frame
       - Flat, uniform backgrounds (like conveyor belts)
       - Good lighting conditions
       - Objects placed on solid surfaces
    
    3. **Performance Notes**  
       Detection quality could decreases when:
       - Objects overlap or are too close
       - Backgrounds are cluttered
       - Lighting is uneven or creates shadows
